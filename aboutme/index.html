    <h2>Juan Quezada</h2>

    <p> I am 21 years old and I'm from Bolivia. I live in Brazil in this moment.
        I have been three years here in this amazing country.
        I am a teacher in the MTC of Brazil. I enjoy to learn new things and visit new places. In June of the last year
        I got married! I love programmming computers and websites. That's why I'm here in this course!</p>

    <p> I hope that this semester we can learn a lot together!</p>

    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      I am a passionate and ambitious individual with a deep love for technology and sports.
      Currently, I am studying web and computer programming with the goal of using my skills
      to help people through the use of technology. I have a strong desire to explore new places
      and have been fortunate enough to have traveled to many exciting destinations. Spending time
      with my family is incredibly important to me, and I cherish every moment that I get to share with
      them. Originally from Bolivia, I now reside in Brazil and am always seeking new experiences and
      challenges. My favorite television series is Suits because it captivates me with its engaging storyline
      and well-developed characters. Ultimately, my greatest aspiration is to achieve happiness and
      fulfillment in both my personal and professional life while sharing those experiences with my loved ones.
